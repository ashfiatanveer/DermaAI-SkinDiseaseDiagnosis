Vitiligo isn't inherently painful or contagious, but it can lead to emotional distress and social stigma due to its noticeable appearance. Besides the prominent depigmented patches, individuals with vitiligo might experience premature graying of scalp hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows, further highlighting the contrast with unaffected skin areas."""
